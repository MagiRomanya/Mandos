** DONE Basic rigid body fixed point implementation
CLOSED: [2023-12-08 dv. 19:59]
** DONE Test the rigid body constraint implementation
CLOSED: [2023-12-09 ds. 16:01]
* NO Add rigid body to the Simulation editor :GUI:
CLOSED: [2024-01-21 dg. 01:12]
* DONE Implement axis angle rotation to axis angle update
CLOSED: [2024-01-21 dg. 01:13]
* NO Add a way for the editor to manage frozen DoF :GUI:
CLOSED: [2024-01-21 dg. 01:12]

* DONE Manage simulation and render meshes separately :RENDER:
CLOSED: [2024-02-20 Tue 09:26]
* DONE Add a GUI to the render :GUI:RENDER:
CLOSED: [2024-02-20 Tue 09:26]
The GUI must be simple and rely only on the simulation and the render.
** DONE GUI to change the materials of the meshes
CLOSED: [2024-02-20 Tue 09:26]
* DONE Create a better camera :RENDER:
CLOSED: [2024-02-20 Tue 09:26]
* TODO Implement an arena to avoid heap allocations in every simulation step :PERFORMANCE:
** DONE Memory arena implemented
CLOSED: [2023-12-08 dv. 20:01]
** TODO Integrate the arena into the simulation loop

* TODO Implement FEM :SIMULATION:
** DONE Implement energy derivatives
** DONE Test FEM energy derivatives with a simple tetrahedron :SIMULATION:TESTING:
CLOSED: [2023-11-22 Wed 15:26]
** DONE Implement TETGEN tetrahedron mesh :GEOMETRY:
CLOSED: [2023-11-23 Thu 16:58]
** TODO Implement embedded mesh to handle contact and render :GEOMETRY:
** DONE Implement Neo Hookean material :SIMULATION:
CLOSED: [2024-01-21 dg. 01:13]
** DONE Implement positive definite Hessian projection :SIMULATION:
CLOSED: [2024-02-20 Tue 09:26]


* TODO Put most of the headers to the src directory and only let the user include mandos and viewmandos
** TODO Figure out a way to hide the underlying structs e.g. RigidBody, Particle etc and only use the mandos API.
Maybe this can be done using forward declaration struct RigidBody; and pointers.
